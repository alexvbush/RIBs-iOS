# RIBs Tutorial 2: Composing RIBs

This project is the starting point for [tutorial 2](https://github.com/uber/RIBs/wiki/iOS-Tutorial-2) that will get you aquatinted with the RIBs architecture.

### Getting started
First you need to install pods for the tutorial:

```
gem install cocoapods # In case you don't have it
cd <RIBs path>/ios/tutorials/tutorial2
pod install
```

Then, open the TicTacToe.xcworkspace that was generated by `pod install` and follow the steps described in [tutorial 2](https://github.com/uber/RIBs/wiki/iOS-Tutorial-2) on the RIBs wiki.
