# RIBs Tutorial 3: RIB Depenmdency Injection and Communication


This project is the completed code for [tutorial 2](https://github.com/uber/RIBs/wiki/iOS-Tutorial-2) and the starting point for [tutorial 3](https://github.com/uber/RIBs/wiki/iOS-Tutorial-3).

### Getting started
First you need to install pods for the tutorial:

```
gem install cocoapods # In case you don't have it
cd <RIBs path>/ios/tutorials/tutorial3
pod install
```

Then, open the TicTacToe.xcworkspace that was generated by `pod install` and follow the steps described in [tutorial 3](https://github.com/uber/RIBs/wiki/iOS-Tutorial-3) on the RIBs wiki.
